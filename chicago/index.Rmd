---

## The Burgess concentric zone model

From _The City_, 1925: 

> _In the expansion of the city a process of distribution takes place which sifts and sorts and relocates individuals and groups by residence and occupation.  The resulting differentiation of the cosmopolitan American city into areas is typically all from one pattern, with only interesting minor modifications._

## Components of the model

## The "inner city"

From _The City_, 1925: 

> _In the zone of deterioration encircling the central business section are always to be found the so-called "slums" and "bad lands," with their submerged regions of poverty, degradation, and disease, and their underworlds of crime and vice._

## The "ethnic enclave"

From _The City_, 1925: 

> _The slums are also crowded to over-flowing with immigrant colonies -- the Ghetto, Little Sicily, Greektown, Chinatown -- fascinatingly combining old world heritages and American adaptations_

## Geography and upward mobility

From _The City_, 1925: 

> _The next zone is also inhabited predominatingly by factory and shop workers, but skilled and thrifty. This is an area of second immigrant settlement, generally of the second generation. It is the region of escape from the slum... But the inhabitant of this area in turn looks to the "Promised Land" beyond, to its residential hotels, its apartment-house region, its satellite loops, and its "bright light" areas._
