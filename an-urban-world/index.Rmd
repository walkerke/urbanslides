## Urban definitions

United Nations (https://esa.un.org/unpd/wup/): 

> _There is no common global definition of what constitutes an urban settlement... The criteria for classifying
an area as urban may be based on one or a combination of characteristics, such as: a
minimum population threshold; population density; proportion employed in non-agricultural
sectors; the presence of infrastructure such as paved roads, electricity, piped water or
sewers; and the presence of education or health services._

US Census: _urban areas_ and _urban clusters_

## Urban definitions

Lewis Mumford, "What is a City?" (1937)

> _The city in its complete sense, then, is a geographic plexus, an economic organization, an institutional process, a theater of social action, and an aesthetic symbol of collective unity._

## Qualitative methods

About Washington Park in Chicago, from 1940 HOLC rating documents: 

> _This venture has the realtors guessing as to what the ultimate result will be when so many of this race are drawn into this section from the already negro-blighted district; particularly its effect on the section east and south of Cottage Grove, and to park and water frontage on Lake Michigan. Already Washington Park at the south, a very fine park, has been almost completely monopolized by the colored race._
